private cloud, and then click Next.
Step 7: In VIP Templates, select each VIP template that you want to make available to the 
private cloud, and then click Next.
Step 8: In Port Classifications, select each port classification that you want to make 
available to the cloud, and then click Next.
Step 9: In Storage, if you have storage managed by VMM, select each storage classification 
that you want to make available to the private cloud, and then click Next.
Step 10: In Library > Stored VM path, browse and select the library share you want to use 
for the self-service users to store VMs. Click OK.
Step 11: In Read-only library shares > Add, select one or more library shares where 
administrators can provide read-only resources to cloud users. Click OK and then click Next.
Step 12: In Capacity, set capacity limits for the private cloud, and then click Next.
Step 13: In Capability Profiles, select each virtual machine capability profile that you want 
to add, and then click Next. Select the capability profiles that match the type of hypervisor 
platforms that are running in the selected host groups. The built-in capability profiles 
represent the minimum and maximum values that can be configured for a virtual machine for 
each supported hypervisor platform.
Step 14: In Replication Groups, select the replication groups for the private cloud, and 
click Next.
Step 15: In Summary page, confirm the settings, and then click Finish.
Step 16: View status in Jobs and ensure the job is complete.

Install and Deploy DPM

i. Install DPM
1. If required, extract the DPM 2016.exe (for DPM 2016)/DPM 2019.exe (for DPM 
2019) file onto the machine on which you want to run DPM. To do this, run the exe 
file, and on the Welcome screen, select Next. In Select Destination Location, specify 
where you want to extract the installation files to. In Ready to Extract, select Extract. 
After the extraction finishes, go to the specified location and run Setup.exe.
2. On the Welcome page of DPM Setup, select Next. On the License Terms page, accept 
the agreement > OK.
3. On the Prerequisites Check page, wait for the check and resolve any issues before 
proceeding.
4. On the Product Registration page, select Next. On the Microsoft Update OptIn page, choose whether you want to include DPM in your Microsoft Updates.
5. On the Summary of Settings page, check the settings and select Install. After the 
installation is completed, select Close. It will automatically launch a Windows update 

ii. Deploy the DPM protection agent
1. After you've installed the DPM agent manually, you'll need to attach the agent to the 
DPM server
2. In the DPM Administrator Console, on the navigation bar, 
select Management > Agents. In the Actions pane, select Install.
3. On the Select Agent Deployment Method page, select Attach agents > Computer 
on a trusted domain > Next. The Protection Agent Installation Wizard opens.
4. On the Select Computers page, DPM displays a list of available computers in the 
same domain as the DPM server. Select one or more computers (50 maximum) from 
the Computer name list > Add > Next.
5. If this is the first time you've used the wizard, DPM queries Active Directory to get a 
list of potential computers. After the first installation, DPM displays the list of 
computers in its database, which is updated once each day by the auto-discovery 
process.
6. To add multiple computers by using a text file, select the Add From File button, and 
in the Add From File dialog box, type the location of the text file or select Browse to 
navigate to its location.
7. On the Enter Credentials page, type the username and password for a domain 
account that is a member of the local Administrators group on all selected computers. 
In the Domain box, accept or type the domain name of the user account that you're 
using to install the protection agent on the target computer. This account may belong 
to the domain that the DPM server is located in or to a trusted domain. If you're 
installing a protection agent on a computer across a trusted domain, enter your current 
domain user credentials. You can be a member of any trusted domain, and you must 
be a member of the local Administrators group on all selected computers that you 
want to protect.
8. On the Summary page, select Attach.

iii. Deploy protection groups 
A System Center Data Protection Manager (DPM) protection group is a collection of data 
sources such as volumes, shares, or application workloads, which have common backup and 
restore settings. The protection group settings specify:
Data sources - The servers, computers, and workloads you want to protect.
Back-up storage - How the protected data should be backed up in the short-term and longterm.
Recovery points - The recovery points from which replicated data can be recovered.
Allocated disk space - The disk space allocated to data from the storage pool.
Initial replication - How the initial replication of data should be handled using either over 
the network or manually offline.
Consistency checks - How the replicated data should be checked for consistency.

iv. Configure firewall settings
To open Windows Firewall, go to the Start menu, select Run, type WF.msc, and then 
select OK.
Keep default settings
When you open the Windows Defender Firewall for the first time, you can see the default 
settings applicable to the local computer. The Overview panel displays security settings for each type of network to which the device can connect.


Maintain the default settings in Windows Defender Firewall whenever possible. These 
settings have been designed to secure your device for use in most network scenarios. One key 
example is the default Block behavior for Inbound connections
